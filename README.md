# Overview

This is heavily inspired b the [OpenVegaPlus](https://github.com/alvaroalea/OpenVegaPlus) project. But I've hacked around the code quite substantially.

Currently it should support a variety of different boards - have a look in `platform.io` for inspiration.

# Warning

This is just me messing around - I'm not going to provide any support for this project in its current state. It's purely for my own amusement.

You are free to use it. The OpenVegaPlus project was released under the GNU GPL - so this project is too.
